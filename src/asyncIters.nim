  This package implements asynchronous iterators. For more information about asynchronous procedures
  in general, see `std/asyncdispatch`_ documentation.

    ##[
      Type of async iterators after they are processed.

      This type is not declared if you pass `-d=asyncBackend=none`:option: (or some unrecognized
      backend name) to the compiler. Known backends include `asyncdispatch`_ (used by default
      if not set explicitly) and `chronos`_. If you’d like to use `asyncIters` with a backend that
      did not exist at the moment of writing, you need to use `customAsyncIterator`_ and specify
      some `Future`_-like type.

      Note also that this is only a *suggested* iterator type. Nothing stops you from using
      a different one or even having multiple in the same program.
